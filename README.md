<h1>The Power of Promises and the $q Service</h1>

This project is simply to help illustrate the differences between regular callback functions and promises, 
and also to show the benefits of using promises over using callbacks. I put this together to fulfill a request from my supervisor
to deliver a presentation on Angular promises for my UI team.

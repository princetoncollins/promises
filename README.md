<h1>The Power of Promises</h1>
<h3>AngularJS Promises & $q Service VS. Regular Callbacks</h3>

This project is simply to help illustrate the differences between regular callback functions and AngularJS promises 
as well as to show what the benefits are from using promises over using callbacks. I put this together to fulfill a request from my supervisor to deliver a presentation on Angular promises for my UI team.
